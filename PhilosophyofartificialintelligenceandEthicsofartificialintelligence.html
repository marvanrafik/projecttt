	This section should include only a brief summary of another article.
	There are three philosophical questions related to AI: 
	<br>
	<br>

	1-Whether artificial general intelligence is possible; whether a machine can solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence, or if there are hard limits to what a machine can accomplish. <br>
	2-Whether intelligent machines are dangerous; how humans can ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically. <br>
	3-Whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do; if a machine can be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights âˆ’ and if a machine can intentionally cause harm </p>
