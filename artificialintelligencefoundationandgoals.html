<h1>//Artificial intelligence foundation and goals:</h1>

<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.After AlphaGo defeated a professional Go player in 2015, artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences . Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).</p>

	The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.AGI is among the field's long-term goals.Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
